	<div class="div2">
	   <p>The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea<br>
       In a beautiful pea-green boat,<br>
       They took some honey, and plenty of money,<br>
       Wrapped up in a five-pound note.<br>
       The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
       And sang to a small guitar,<br>
      "O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,<br>
       What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
       You are,<br>
       You are!<br>
       What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</p>
    
       <p>Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!<br>
       How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
       O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br>
       But what shall we do for a ring?"<br>
       They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
       To the land where the Bong-Tree grows<br>
       And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br>
       With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
       His nose,<br>
       His nose,<br>
       With a ring at the end of his nose.</p>
    
       <p class="para3">"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br>
       Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."<br>
       So they took it away, and were married next day<br>
       By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<br>
       They dined on mince, and slices of quince,<br>
       Which they ate with a runcible spoon;<br>
       And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br>
       They danced by the light of the moon,<br>
       The moon,<br>
       The moon,<br>
       They danced by the light of the moon.</p>
